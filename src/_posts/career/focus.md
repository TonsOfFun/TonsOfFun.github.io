In 2010 after losing our house and moving to a new city my dad and I set out to change our fortune. Founding Focus Testing Services we planned to establish our new business as a third option in the space for providing certificaiton exams to individuals seeking FAA credentials as pilots, mechanics, instructors, and more. This was my first and most personal startup experience.

With guidance from my dad, I lead the build out of an on premise server room. We used Ubuntu 8.04 (maybe 10.04?) and MySQL. With the guidance of my mentor [Sandeep Giri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeepgiri/), a business colleague of my dad, and family friend, we built our software with a team of Nepalese developers. 

We had the team of developers in Nepal building out a PHP backend for our desktop application built using adobe Flex Builder. I built our registration and management web application using Ruby on Rails connecting to the same MySQL database as the test administration application.

I also helped setup our office with Cisco VOIP phones, Ubuntu Desktop workstations, and UPS battery backups througout. We were ready for business, but just needed approval.

The deciding factor would be FAA approval as a test provider. We saw this as an undenieable opportunity with one of the incumbents two providers being acquired by a large education organizaiton. We traveled to the FAA's HQ in Oklahoma City, OK. There we met with their directors and presented our software demo and the case for there needing to be additional affordable options for testing centers.

Ultimately this was a lesson in acceptance. No matter how great a product you build, you need customers. Without FAA approval we couldn't provide the services to our prospective customers, many of whom were eager to use our product since we had established relationships with them. Even with our connections within the government organization, the FAA denied our application. 

This came as a shock and a huge blow to my family. We took a risk, betting on our success, and we lost. We attempted to pivot the business into various sectors that also required testing, but it became clear the large incumbents had more of a hold on the industry than our bootstrapped startup could break into.
