I founded GreenThumb.io after participating in a series of hackathons called Apps for Ag. I placed 3rd in the first hackathon in Coalinga, California. My placing in the second hackathon at UC Davis earned me the incorporation costs for GreenThumb, which were paid for by the event sponsor. I volunteered as an advisor and mentor for the participants in the third event of that series in Salinas.


GreenThumb is a computer vision product that I built for plant leaf and bud area analysis. I used Ruby, Rails, Sidekiq, Python, OpenCV, Postgres, PostGIS, Redis, Raspberry Pi, WebSockets - ActionCable (AnyCable-Go) to build the product. Initially GreenThumb IO was designed to track records of consumables used by storing details in a geo-spatial index. This provided agronomists and farmers with location based feeds of notes and accumulated fertilizer and pestiside applications to ensure targets were met, tracked, and archived for reference.

I also used real-time image processing with Rails and Sidekiq, and custom Python OpenCV algorithms exposed in an image service via Thumbor OpenCV engine.

GreenThumb was a valuable tool for farmers because it helps them to monitor their crops and identify potential problems early on. The product is also used by researchers to study plant growth and development.

I am proud of the work that I have done on GreenThumb. It is a product that has the potential to make a real difference in the world. I am excited to continue working on it and to see how it can be used to help farmers and researchers alike.
