When Cainthus pivoted to dairy cow monitoring we had a new set of challenges to achieve our goals to raise our Series B funding. 
With our Series A funds in the bank, we had an opportunity to grow the team to meet the occasion. 
## From Data Science R&D to Product Engineering 
The differences in R&D output compared to the engineering product tend to require different skillsets unique to either disapline.
### It's important to specialize
Researchers like to develop innovative proof of concepts. These products of R&D are rarely ready for the end user. 
Sometimes the stand alone model is ready for production, but the software architecture and infrastructure required to reliably scale the production offering to market takes a different skillset. 
product engineers like to build production quality solutions thag provide unique and satisfying user experiences.
### delegate and distribute
Separating the research from the product engineering responsibilities enables specialists to maintain their flow state without having to break focus to context switch. 
This has become common in software engineering organizations with frontend and backend developers. DevOps engineers being a further example of infrastructure specialization. 
### What? (maybe link to the final solution?)
Backend Engineering, Data Engineering, Platform Engineering, and ML Engineering share similar domain space and require knowledge and understanding of software architecture and the infrastructure required to build scalable solutions. 

DevOps and MLOps require a deeper understanding of the tooling and frameworks used to implement reusable, resilient infrastructure. 
MLOps is an extension of DevOps requiring an understanding of the ML/DL frameworks used for training/evalusting as well as the runtimes used for deploying inference engines. 
## From data scientist to product engineer
Sometimes people's backgrounds might be different than their current interests or career goals. As a data scientist one might typically be focused more on experimenting, evaluating, and innovating new algorithms and models. Just cause you have a PhD doesn't mean you have to work in R&D and with the right passion and motivation one is capable of becoming a great product engineer.
### Phd with an interest in egineering production software
I had an experience leading the founding data sciencist to becoming our lead product engineer, and eventually my Director of Engineering. They had a nack for software architecture and an interest in the unique DevOps challenges we had to overcome in order to deploy to a specialized hybrid cloud-edge processing pipeline for realtime computer vision. We had worked together to build the drone application with a cloud backend using Celery background jobs to preprocess GeoJPEGs to GeoTIFFs
### Selecting directors to scale the org
### R&D, Product Science, and Product Engineering teams formed
### Processes and workflows for successful AI orgs
## what we started with
