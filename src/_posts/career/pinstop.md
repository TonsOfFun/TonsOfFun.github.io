Pinstop is a startup that develops custom itinerary mapping platforms for concierge teams at luxury hotels. Our platform helps concierges create personalized itineraries for their guests based on their interests and preferences. We also developed a recommendation engine for travel experiences, which helps guests discover new and exciting things to do in their destination.

The target customers were the Ritz Carlton and Grand Hyatt Tokyo, both of which were using a legacy system that was EOL (end of life) and would lose access by the end of the year. The product we designed allow the concierge teams to catalog their own curated dataset of location marker with bespoke information for their guest. The system used Google Places API as an initial source of information with the ability to move map markers to save custom coordinates. This was an especially important usecase for the concierge staff as they'd often direct their clientel to alternative entrances. 

The product also had an iteneray feature set that provided guests with printable maps with the Japanese address and their localized translation for foreigners. This was designed for guest to be able to read where their itenerary to know were going, but at the same time enable them to hand off the printout to taxi drivers who wouldn't be able to understand the street address format if it weren't in Japanese. Japan has a unique way of denoted the address of a building where streets addresses are not sequential, but rather in order of when the building was built on the block.

One of the most interesting things about working in Tokyo is the fast-paced and competitive environment. The city is constantly active, and businesses need to be able to adapt quickly in order to succeed. At the time I was also managing a remotely distributed team for a strtup based out of Ireland. Our standups were at 8AM pacific which put at midnight in Tokyo. I managed to continue with that scheudle and would walk the bustling city streets after the standup around 1AM. My walk would always take me from Akasaka to Nishiazabu on the edge of the Aoyama cemetary. This is where my favorite ramen shop AKANOREN is located. They're open until 4AM daily so it was the perfect spot to wind down.

I was responsible for designing and developing the platform, as well as managing the tech and business teams. It was a challenging but rewarding experience. I learned a lot about Japanese culture and business, and I'm proud of the work we did at Pinstop. This was a great learning experience for me, and it helped me to develop my skills as a leader and entrepreneur. I also enjoyed the opportunity to work with a talented team. We were able to create a product that was both innovative and user-friendly. I'm confident that Pinstop will continue to be successful in the years to come.

If you're looking for a challenge and an opportunity to experience a new culture, I highly recommend working in Tokyo or abroad. It was an amazing experience for me, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have worked at Pinstop.
Here are some of the things I learned during my time at Pinstop:
The importance of teamwork and collaboration
The need to be adaptable and flexible
The value of user-centered design
The importance of continuous learning and improvement

I'm excited to take what I learned at Pinstop and apply it to my future endeavors. I'm confident that my experience in Tokyo will help me to be successful in whatever I do next.
