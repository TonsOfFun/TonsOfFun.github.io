Introduction:
I'm a CTO consultant at Silicon Valley Software Group. In this role, I lead tech due diligence for $100M+ venture capital and private equity fundraising rounds and acquisitions. I audit businesses, teams, processes, and technology. I provide comprehensive reports to stakeholders to assess and mitigate risks while managing technical expectations. I also advise and lead on the integration of business and products post-acquisition.
Body:
I've been a CTO consultant for over 10 years. In that time, I've worked with a variety of companies, from startups to Fortune 500s. I've helped them with everything from tech strategy to product development to M&A.
One of the most important things I do as a CTO consultant is tech due diligence. This involves assessing the technology of a company that is looking to raise capital or be acquired. I look at things like the company's product roadmap, its technology stack, and its team's technical skills. I also assess the company's risk profile and make recommendations for how to mitigate those risks.
Another important part of my job is auditing businesses, teams, processes, and technology. This involves assessing the effectiveness of a company's operations and making recommendations for improvement. I also look for areas where the company is at risk and make recommendations for how to mitigate those risks.
I provide comprehensive reports to stakeholders to assess and mitigate risks while managing technical expectations. These reports include my findings, recommendations, and risks. I also include a timeline for implementing my recommendations and a budget for the project.
I also advise and lead on the integration of business and products post-acquisition. This involves working with the two companies to integrate their businesses and products. I also help to manage the transition and make sure that the integration is successful.
Conclusion:
I'm passionate about helping companies succeed. I enjoy working with a variety of companies and helping them to achieve their goals. I'm also passionate about technology and I enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest trends.
