    label: Docker
    description: Docker makes development and deployment dependencies repeatable and consistent. Using images to lock in requirements for things like OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, all with NVIDIA's Docker Engine for CUDA support make onboarding, developing, and deploying with remote containers a breeze. I've used Docker Hub for private organizations and even host a few of my own images there.

    color: "#DC382D"
    experience: Redis is a high performance in-memory data store I've used for caching things like rendered views and geocoder look ups. It's a great jobs queue for Sidekiq and is the foundation for Faktory. It's also a powerful PubSub message broker that is used for things like WebSocket broadcasting with ActionCable for live updates pushed from the server to the users.

    description: I've build a few microservices with Sinatra to expose APIs with Ruby. One of the most interesting examples that made it to production was a geocoding service that took coordinates and returned location names using OSM, PostGIS, and Redis for a caching layer. It could handle batches of coordinates with a custom stored proceedure and serviced tens of millions of requests a day.
