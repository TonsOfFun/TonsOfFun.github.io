      date: "November"
      location: "Houston, Texas, USA"
    title: "Discover Machine Learning in Ruby"
    description: We can use Ruby to do anything we as a community want. Today we’ll explore the work of a hidden gem of a contributor in our community, Andrew Kane, and their Ruby gems for Machine Learning. We will see how contemporary computer vision neural networks can run with Ruby. Ruby is all about developer happiness. Computer Vision is something that brings me great joy as it delivers satisfying visual feedback and connects our code with the real world through images and videos in a way that wasn’t accessible until the last decade or so.

    title: "Computer Vision on Rails"
    description:  Learn about combining Rails and Python for Computer Vision. We'll be analyzing images of cannabis plants in real-time and deriving insights from changes in leaf area & bud site areas. We'll explore when to use traditional statistical analysis versus ML approaches, as well as other ways CV has been deployed. We’ll cover integrating OpenCV with ActionCable & Sidekiq for broadcasting camera analysis to Rails and creating time-lapse style renderings with graphs. You will gain an understanding of what tools to use and where to start if you’re interested in using ML or CV with your Rails project!
